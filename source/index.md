# Introduction

Welcome to the Kotive API, and thank you for using Kotive!

Our API is build around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer), so all calls can be made using simple and predictable URLs! All of our URLs start with `https://webapp.kotive.com/api`, and can be accessed with <strong>SSL only</strong>.

More content still coming here, etc., etc., etc.
